# Data-Science-Projects
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex Praktikum.

Yandex Praktikum data scientist program prepares me for a career as a data scientist by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and apply machine learning and deep learning methods to solve problems. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib), machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), deep learning library (Keras) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.
